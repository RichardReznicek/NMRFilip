The two simulated simplified sample datasets provided in this directory are intended for a quick evaluation of the NMRFilip software if no suitable experimental data are readily available. The first one illustrates an inversion recovery experiment using vdlist, while the second one demonstrates a broadband spectrum acquired step-by-step with the CPMG sequence using ulist. 

Various physical (e.g. noise) and technical (e.g. ring-down artifacts) aspects were omitted from the simulations for the sake of simplicity. Further, the content of the dataset directories presents only a subset of files constituting typical experimental datasets. The acqus files comprise only selected parameters. 

THIS PAIR OF SAMPLE DATASETS IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
